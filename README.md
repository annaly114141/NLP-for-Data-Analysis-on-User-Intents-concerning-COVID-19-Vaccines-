Natural Language Processing for Data Analysis on User Intents concerning COVID-19 Vaccines

## Scope
Communicating findings and insights using written explanations and data visualizations using text analysis on data from VIRA.

## Data set details
Data for this task comes from the Vaccine Information Resource Assistant (VIRA) Conversation Corpus openly released by IBM research. They are in the context of VIRA, a chat bot that aims to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (vaxchat.org). 
1. The Intent dataset contains diverse queries mapped to peopleâ€™s intents concerning COVID- 19 vaccines, and can be used to detect common user intents when conversing in a task- oriented dialogue setting.

## Research Questions
What are the most common user intents related to COVID-19 vaccines that are detected using the Intent dataset?

## Methods: 
By using advanced text analysis techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and exploring python packages such as BERTopic, it is possible to extract valuable insights from the Intent dataset regarding common user intents related to COVID-19 vaccines.
